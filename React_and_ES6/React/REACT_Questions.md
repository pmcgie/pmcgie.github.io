In this activity, we will begin by installing a few helpful packages and then explore the React documentation to answer questions.

## Instructions

### Part 1

* Begin installing both the Create React App and Yarn packages globally by running the following command in your terminal:

### Part 2

* While those are installing, work with your group to answer each of the following questions using the [ReactJS Documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react/):

1. In the previous section we just installed two packages, Create React App and Yarn. What are they for?

React App:

Yarn:
