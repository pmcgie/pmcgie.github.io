                        <p>More About Me:</p>

                        <p>
                            I love to travel! I love exploring new places, experiencing new cultures, and adventuring into the outdoors.
                            One of the most memorable places I've been to was New Zealand. While in New Zealand, I rafted the highest commercially waterfall (21 feet),
                            hiked up to Mueller's Hut in Mount Cook National Park, pack-rafted in glacial waters at Mount Aspiring National Park, and even did a free-fall
                            into a canyon!
                        </p>
                        <br> 
                        <p>
                            I love to learn! As the world changes, it's important to diversify my skillset and stay on top of current trends. In general, I have my bachelor's degree as well as my MBA from the University of Minnesota.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            I love to meet new people! Friendships, networking and gaining multiple perspectives are very important.
