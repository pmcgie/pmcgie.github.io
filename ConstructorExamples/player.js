/*Over the course of this assignment you are going to put together a function which uses constructors and user input to create and manage a team of players.

Start out by creating a constructor function called “Player” with the following properties and methods...

name: Property which contains the player’s name
position: Property which holds the player’s position
offense: Property which is a value between 1 and 10 to show how good this player is on offense
defense: Property which is a value between 1 and 10 to show how good this player is on defense
goodGame: Method which increases either the player’s offense or defense property based upon a coinflip.
badGame: Method which decreases either the player’s offense or defense property based upon a coinflip.
printStats: Method which prints all of the player’s properties to the screen
Now create a program which allows the user to create 3 unique players; 2 starters and a sub. It should take as user input the name, position, offense, and defense of each player.

Once all of the players have been created, print their stats.

HINT: Remember to use recursion when looping with inquirer! Otherwise your program might not return the prompts as you expect.*/
